ifm-geomar_rep49.pdf,What is the visibility of the environment and how to measure it?,"****Visibility of the environment:**

    The visibility of the environment is measured by observing the lateral extent of the gas plume in x, y, and z directions.
    The visibility can also be determined by the depth at which the bubbles are detectable in the water column during surveys.
    Changes in the lateral extent and depth of the gas plume between surveys indicate variations in visibility.
    The tidal curve, which shows the tide's rise or fall during surveys, can also influence visibility.
    Imaging technology, such as bubble imaging, is used to visualize and measure the visibility of gas seeps in the environment.**",2
