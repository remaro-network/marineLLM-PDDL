ifm-geomar_rep49.pdf,What is the temperature of water on the surface?,"**Based on the provided context, the text mentions that the observatory records bottom water temperature and pressure at the position of the observatory. However, it doesn't specifically mention the temperature of the water on the surface. Therefore, based on the information available, the exact temperature of the water on the surface is not explicitly provided.**",3
