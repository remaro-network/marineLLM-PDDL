noaa_10541_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water on the surface?,"**Based on the provided context, the temperature of water on the surface is not explicitly mentioned. The data described includes measurements such as dissolved gases, pH, alkalinity, nutrients, dissolved organic and inorganic matter, trace metals, and marine pollutants. The temperature may also be measured, but it is not specifically highlighted in the information provided.**",3

noaa_29521_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water on the surface?,"**In this context, there is specific data on the temperature of the water collected using Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) Systems, where XBTs were collected every six hours or more frequently as oceanographic conditions dictated. Additionally, Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) measurements were collected using an integrated ROV CTD system and a dedicated CTD lowered with a winch. The CTD measurements include temperature data.**",2
