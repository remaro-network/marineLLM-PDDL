noaa_41602_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water in depth?,"**The temperature of water at depth is typically measured using instruments like the CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) or specific probes like the SeaBird SBE-38 Surface seawater temperature probe. These instruments provide accurate temperature readings at different depths in the water column.**",3
noaa_27817_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water in depth?,**The specific data included in the information provided regarding the temperature of the water at different depths during the dives mentioned are time series plots of the temperature sensor data during the dives. This means that the data shows how the water temperature changes over time during the dives at various depths.**,3
noaa_50752_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water in depth?,**The specific measurements provided in the context regarding the water at depth include: 1. Salinity measurements above 30 ppt using a portable refractometer at 22°C for 13 seawater samples. 2. Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 40 mL subsamples using Method 524.3. 3. Extraction of other hydrocarbons from 1 L bottles with dichloromethane. 4. Detection of oil droplets at depths of 10-15m using an AUV's holographic camera during Mission 7.**,3

noaa_29521_DS1.pdf,What is the temperature of water in depth?,"**The specific information provided in the context is related to the collection of water temperature data using Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) systems and Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) measurements. XBTs were collected every six hours or more frequently, and CTD measurements were collected using integrated ROV CTD systems or dedicated CTDs lowered with a winch. The data from these systems helped in understanding water temperature variations at different depths during the exploration dives.**",3
